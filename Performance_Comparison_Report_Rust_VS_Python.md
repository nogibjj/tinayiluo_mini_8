### Comparison Report: Python vs Rust for Extract Action on a SQL Database

#### 1. Overview:

The extract action was performed on a SQL Database using both Python and Rust. Here, we will analyze the runtime and resource usage differences between the two implementations, based on the provided data.

#### 2. Python Performance:

- **First Execution (test_main):**
  - Time Taken: 551,253.9149999612 microseconds (or 551.25 milliseconds)
  - Memory Used: 3,840.0 kB

- **Second Execution (make python_extract):**
  - Time Taken: 351,128.521000021 microseconds (or 351.13 milliseconds)
  - Memory Used: 4,096.0 kB

#### 3. Rust Performance:

- **Execution (make extract):**
  - Time Taken: 197,745 microseconds (or 197.75 milliseconds)
  - Memory Used: 0 kB

#### 4. Analysis:

- **Runtime Efficiency:**
  - Rust's execution time (197.75 ms) is considerably faster than both the first (551.25 ms) and second (351.13 ms) Python executions. Specifically, Rust outperforms Python by approximately 63.8% in the first execution and 43.7% in the second execution in terms of speed.
  
- **Memory Efficiency:**
  - The Rust implementation utilizes significantly less memory, consuming 0 kB, while both Python executions use memory in the range of 3,840.0 kB to 4,096.0 kB.
  
- **Consistency:**
  - The Python code shows a variance between the two runs: the second execution is faster and uses slightly more memory. This difference might be due to caching effects or differences in the environment/setup between the two Python runs. On the other hand, the Rust performance is consistent and predictable in the given data.

#### 5. Potential Reasons for the Differences:

- **Memory Management:**
  - Rust employs a different memory management mechanism than Python. With Rust's ownership model and zero-cost abstractions, it can optimize resource usage without the overhead of a garbage collector, as in Python.

- **Language Efficiency:**
  - Rust, being a systems programming language, is compiled to machine code and generally offers better runtime performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.

- **Library and Implementation Differences:**
  - The exact functionalities of the extract action in both languages could differ, impacting performance. Differences in the way libraries are written and optimized in each language might also contribute to the variations.

#### 6. Conclusion:

Rust showcases a superior performance in both time and memory usage when compared to Python for the extract action on a SQL Database. While Python offers flexibility and ease of use, Rust's efficiency, predictable performance, and optimal resource management make it an excellent choice for tasks where performance is a key criterion.
